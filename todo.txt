- Group member can pull a task that is assingned to the group
	- can put back (if initially assigned to a group)
- complete & cancel flow
- Actions going back to a previous one should be assigned the user who worked on that one. 
- Primary actions should be on the most right, warnings are left of them, secondary on the left side. 


Later:
