Todo:

- save form values
	- convert date values from int[] to DateTime values.
	- Field Name * (for required fields)
	- scenarios
		- leave request
			- 1st step: start date - end date
			- 2nd step: readonly start - end date
				- comment (if you'd like to include the reason)
			- 3rd step: those two values read only.
- reports?
	- manager report (process or task?)
		- pick groups 
		- show items [with default selection of 'filter due items']
- when assigned to manager
	- no manager? -> process owner , no process owner->same person (notification in any case)
- login
	- side nav visibility
- assign to group manager
- notifications
- create paralel tasks
- deactivate buttons when a request is sent


Later:
- collection group queries
	- how to apply exactly
	- can it be projected under a path?
	- https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/blob/master/apis/Google.Cloud.Firestore/Google.Cloud.Firestore.IntegrationTests/QueryTest.cs
- as default user picture, initials and a specific color background
	- same for processes
- put back to group
- Actions going back to a previous one should be assigned the user who worked on that one. 
- ? system/webpage open, user gets user doc each minute, if any task changes, notifies to UI.
- admin ops
	- assign to anyone
	- change values
	- jump process to any step
- user group management
	- denormalize data
- group tasks listed
	- one of them clicked
	- back button
	- load the previous data (should be cached somewhere)
	- then make the request again and update the result
