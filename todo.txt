Todo:
- complete & cancel processflow
- denormalized data arrangment on assignment, creating new tasks, closing tasks.
	- user doc: OrganizationUser.Tasks
	- group: ActiveTaskInstancePaths, ActiveTaskInstancePathsAssignedToUsers
- Primary actions should be on the most right, warnings are left of them, secondary on the left side. 
- task history
- inbox
	- person 
	- groups
- reports?
- when assigned to manager
	- no manager? -> process owner , no process owner->same person (notification in any case)
- login


Later:
- collection group queries
	- how to apply exactly
	- can it be projected under a path?
	- https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/blob/master/apis/Google.Cloud.Firestore/Google.Cloud.Firestore.IntegrationTests/QueryTest.cs
- as default user picture, initials and a specific color background
	- same for processes
- put back to group
- Actions going back to a previous one should be assigned the user who worked on that one.
